<img src="CISimg.jpg" alt="me" style="float:right;width:600px;height:400px;">
<ul>
<li><b>Outdoor Activities</b> </li>
<p> My outdoor hobbies are almost unlimited, I love to hunt, fish, go hiking, almost anything that is outdoors. Im a very outgoing person that loves to experience new things. </p>
<li><b> Golf</b> </li>
<p> Throughout highschool, I worked at a golfcourse as a golf cart attendant. This introduced me to golfing, although I may not be the greatest at it, it is still an enjoyable past time. Getting out on the course and hitting piss missles with some good friends and a cooler full of drinks is always a great time. </p>
</ul>
<h1>Interests</h1>
<ul>
<li><b>Construction</b> </li>
<p> I have done construction all of my life, my dad being a carpenter opened many doors into jobs, and it has almost became a hobby of mine to start projects that deal with woodworking. The coolest part of it is seeing the projects from start to finish. </p>
<li><b> Business</b> </li>
<p> As a kid, I was always fascinated by the show Shark Tank. I had no idea what any of the business terms that they were saying at the time meant, but now as a project management major, understanding how I could make my money work for me sparks my interest in becoming an investor in companies or the stock market some day.</p>
